## Steps

1. **Locate Plans:** Search for all subdirectories in the `implementations/` folder.
2. **Scan Status:** Read the `README.md` or phase files in each folder to determine the percentage of completion.
3. **Analyze Reviews:** Check which plans have a completed `review.md`.
4. **Display Summary:** - **Active:** Plans with unchecked boxes.
   - **Pending Review:** Plans where code is done but `review.md` is empty.
   - **Archive:** Completed and reviewed plans.
