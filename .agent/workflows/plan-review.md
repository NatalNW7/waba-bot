description: # Post-Implementation Review: Conducts a post-implementation review to verify the feature against the initial plan and risks.
---

## Steps
1. **Load Plan Context:** - Read the `README.md` and all `phase-XX.md` files in the target implementation folder.
   - Identify the "Risks & Mitigations" that were predicted at the start.

2. **Code Verification:**
   - Scan the codebase to ensure all tasks listed in the phases were actually implemented.
   - Verify that the **Clean Code Standards** and **NestJS Best Practices** were maintained.

3. **Risk Audit:**
   - Compare the actual implementation results against the `review.md` template.
   - Identify if any predicted risks (e.g., migration issues, circular dependencies) occurred.
   - Document any *unforeseen* issues that arose during development.

4. **Documentation & Tests Check:**
   - Confirm Swagger docs are updated and match the new code.
   - Ensure the new tests pass and provide adequate coverage.

5. **Finalize Review:**
   - Update the `review.md` file in the implementation folder with the final findings.
   - Provide a "Project Success Score" and suggestions for future architectural improvements.
